# project_001

A fully functional full-stack MERN dashboard application with complete CRUD functionalities, authentication, pagination, sorting, filtering, and more!


Alongside building this application; came across:
1. Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js together form the powerful MERN stack
2. Material UI: The most popular UI Component Kit nowadays
3. TypeScript: Used TypeScript on this project!
4. Transformed a Figma design into a fully functioning website
5. Learned how to optimize images and store them on the cloud using Cloudinary
6. Provide a quick and easy way for your users to log in and register using Google Auth
7. Most importantly, built this React-based CRUD application quickly using REFINE.

Tried to deploy it but render was't giving hosting for Free! And others like Vercel and Netlify were not helping on the last minute!


In Order to run the project, one must have all these files in the repository. Only .gitignore files aren't here
Open the project folder in vsCode then open terminal, type and enter;
1. cd mern-dashboard-server .... change directory
2. npm run start ... start server on locathost:8000 Port
3. cd mern-dashboard-client .... change directory
4. npm run dev   ... start the development server then compile the webpackage
    On "Compiled Successfully!" You will be able to view the front-end that is mern-dashboard-client in the browser.
